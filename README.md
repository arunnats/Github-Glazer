**GitHub Glazer** is a React app built with Vite that glazed your GitHub profile. Simply enter a GitHub username, and the app fetches the user's profile information and repositories. It then uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to glaze your profile :)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables for OpenAI and GitHub API keys.
4. Run the app using `npm start`.
